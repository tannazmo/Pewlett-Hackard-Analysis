Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of the new analysis is well defined. (3 pt)
The analysis will help the management to be able to plan ahead and prepare for the upcoming load of retirement resulting in a major staff shortage.

## Results: 
In order to help PH prepare for the silver tsunami that they are facing, we need to know the followings:


* Retiring Employees and their Titles
* Unique Retiring Employees and their most recent Job Title
* Number of Retiring Employees by Title
* Employees Eligible for Mentorship Program

#### Retiring Employees and their Titles
In this analysis we first created a data file containing the employees whose birth year was between 1952 and 1955 as these will be the employees who will be retiring in the next little while as they reach the retirement age.

#### Unique Retiring Employees and their most recent Job Title
We can see that there are some names that appear more than one time, showing all the positions ot titles they have held in PH since they were employed. In order to get a more concise restult, we will only show their latest titles in the unique_titles report:

#### Number of Retiring Employees by Title

Now, knowing their names, we also would like to find out how many of them would be retiring, but better yet, we would like to know the number of the retiring employees by their most recent job title. For this report we created the retiring_titles report:

#### Employees Eligible for Mentorship Program
Having all the data, PH HR departement can better plan for future hiring/promotion to replace the outgoing employees. But the new employees need training! So, who better can train the replacing employees than the retiring employees. So PH will have a mentorship program, but first let's find out which employees are eligible for the mentorship program! For this, we created another data file holding the information of the employees whose birth years are in 1965 who will be trained by the outgoing employees:
